    "\n",
    "The main goal of this assignment consists of creating a simplified version of Splitser (WieBetaaltWat). \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have a group of roommates: Tom, Vanessa, Chiara, Anna, and Natt. All of them are students on a budget and, just like in any other household, some of them buy more things for the house than others: this isn't fair, as the expenses should be split equally. To fix this, they can use Splitser. \n",
    "\n",
    "Splitser is an app that lets each individual in a group log purchases and share the costs with the rest of the group. While Splitser allows the expenses to be shared unequally, in our version, the object is to split the total cost _**equally**_ among all the roommates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, based on a set of purchases made by the roommates for the house, each roommate will either end up with a credit, a debit, or a €0 final balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of Splitser final balances based on purchases made for a household of 5 people. The \"Expenses\" column shows the total amount spent by each person, while the \"Balance\" shows the final balances. It is clear that, in the first example, not all purchases were split equally, so it cannot be recreated with our functions. However, in the second example, you can see how expenses are shared equally, demonstrating the desired outcome of our assignment.\n",

    "- the number of people in the household (an integer)\n",
    "- a list of purchases, e.g. `[5.0 1 10.0 0 6.77 2 3.0 1]` , a concatenation of `float` and `integer`, where each expense (positive `float` number) has to be followed by the ID of the person who made the purchase (`integer`), which needs to be in the right range (greater or equal to 0 and less than the number of people in the household)\n",

    "- In case the parameters do **not** meet our conditions **an error message needs to be *printed***, describing the exact issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The function will *always* return a list.** If the input satisfies the requirements, the list needs to have a length equal to the number of people in the household: the float number at index `i` corresponds to the final balance of the person with ID `i`. Otherwise (if the input does not satisfie the requirements), an error will be printed and an **empty list** will be returned.\n",
